We'll cover the ideas, principles and abstractions that unify computer design â€“ from how your laptop runs multiple programs at the same time, to how companies like Instagram, Airbnb, and Google operate large websites, to how easy it is to exploit security vulnerabilities on badly designed systems. This class is designed for engineers who are interested in learning what programming is, how computer systems work, and why these systems are so critical to modern technology."
