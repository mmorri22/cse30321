    "A computer engineer, Peter Pitfall, is proposing a processor redesign where the register file size will increase. Peter contends that having more registers will mean more ALU instructions, which means this will reduce the number of load instructions by 78% on average (so now there are only <a href = \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgFeZr5ptV8\">22%</a> of load instructions remaining).
