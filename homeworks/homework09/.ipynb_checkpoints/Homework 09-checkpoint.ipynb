    "### Philosophy of this assignment\n",
    "    \n",
    "Every time I teach Computer Architecture, I ask students about their preferred programming languages. And, invariably, they indicate they greatly prefer Python to C or C++. At this point, you now know what is going on \"under the hood.\" But odds are you still prefer Python, and that's OK. (For example, I like Python much more than Java. It's cleaner, more robust, and quite elegant. For all the complaining professors do about the \"old days\", Python's emphasis on tabbing means that students write much cleaner C code - better indendations and whitespace, more intuitive variable names, better algorithmic approaches - than when I first started teaching. Or, frankly, when I was a student.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "The unfortunate reality is that we - the older folks - push students to specialize much faster than I was a student. Worse, we are pushing them to specialize in the same things, which means that not only are students all competiting for the same jobs, but we are not innovating in other areas. The urgency of the CHIPS Act is a symptom of a much larger problem. And this is a disservice to students.\n",
    "    \n",
    "So you should not just strive to demonstrate the skills requested in this assignment. Your bigger takeaway should be an appreciation for how a computer is put together from the ground up. At each level, there are opportunites for innovation and employment (there are opportunities for cache and cash!)\n",
    "\n",
