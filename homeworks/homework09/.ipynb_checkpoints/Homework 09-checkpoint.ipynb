    "### Philosophy of this assignment\n",
    "    \n",
    "Every time I teach Computer Architecture, I ask students about their preferred programming languages. And, invariably, they indicate they greatly prefer Python to C or C++. At this point, you now know what is going on \"under the hood.\" But odds are you still prefer Python, and that's OK. (For example, I like Python much more than Java. It's cleaner, more robust, and quite elegant. For all the complaining professors do about the \"old days\", Python's emphasis on tabbing means that students write much cleaner C code - better indendations and whitespace, more intuitive variable names, better algorithmic approaches - than when I first started teaching. Or, frankly, when I was a student.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "The unfortunate reality is that we - the older folks - push students to specialize much faster than I was a student. Worse, we are pushing them to specialize in the same things, which means that not only are students all competiting for the same jobs, but we are not innovating in other areas. The urgency of the CHIPS Act is a symptom of a much larger problem. And this is a disservice to students.\n",
    "    \n",
    "So you should not just strive to demonstrate the skills requested in this assignment. Your bigger takeaway should be an appreciation for how a computer is put together from the ground up. At each level, there are opportunites for innovation and employment (there are opportunities for cache and cash!)\n",

    "You can visualize how the vectors and the different functions work together by inputting your code into the code environment at this <a href = \"https://piotte13.github.io/SIMD-Visualiser/#/\">link</a>! Another interesting tool that might help you understand the behavior of SIMD instructions is the <a href = \"https://godbolt.org/z/J7HXBk\">Compiler Explorer</a> project. It can also provide a lot of insights when you need to optimize any code in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "> General advice on working with SIMD instructions:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Be ware of memory alignment. For example, <code>_m256d _mm256_load_pd (double const * mem_addr)</code> would not work with unaligned data – you would need <code>_m256d _mm256_loadu_pd</code>. Meanwhile, it is almost always desireable to keep your data aligned (can be achieved using special memory allocation APIs). In fact, when the data is aligned, aligned load/store will give identical performance to an aligned store. Aligned loads can be folded into other operations as a memory operand which reduces code size and throughput slightly. Modern CPUs have very good support for unaligned loads, but there’s still a significant performance hit when a load crosses a cache-line boundary.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Recall various CPU pipeline hazards you have learned earlier this semester. Data hazards can drastically hurt performance. That being said, you may want to check data dependencies in adjacent SIMD operations if not getting the desired performance.\n"

    "    <li><code>void _mm_storeu_si128(__m128i *p, __m128i a)</code> - stores 128-bit vector a into pointer p</li>\n",

    "Recall that the SSE intrinsics are basically functions which perform operations on multiple pieces of data in a vector in parallel. This turns out to be faster than running through a for loop and applying the operation once for each element in the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our sum function, we’ve got a basic structure of iterating through an array. On every iteration, we add an array element to a running sum. To vectorize, you should add a few array elements to a sum vector in parallel and then consolidate the individual values of the sum vector into our desired sum at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hint 1: <code>__m128i</code> is the data type for Intel’s special 128-bit vector. We’ll be using them to encode 4 (four) 32-bit ints.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hint 2: We’ve left you a vector called <code>_127</code> which contains four copies of the number 127. You should use this to compare with some stuff when you implement the condition within the sum loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hint 3: DON’T use the store function (<code>_mm_storeu_si128</code>) until <b>after</b> completing the inner loop! It turns out that storing is very costly and performing a store in every iteration will actually cause your code to slow down. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Hint 4: It’s bad practice to index into the <code>__m128i</code> vector like they are arrays. You should store them into arrays first with the <code>storeu</code> function, and then access the integers elementwise by indexing into the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hint 5: READ the function declarations in the above table carefully! You’ll notice that the loadu and storeu take <code>__m128i*</code> type arguments. You can just cast an int array to a <code>__m128i</code> pointer. Alternatively, you could skip the typecast at the cost of a bunch of compiler warnings.\n",
