### Course Catalog Description

Introduction to <b>basic architectural concepts</b> that are present in <b>current scalar machines</b>, together with an introduction to <b>assembly language programming</b>, <b>computer arithmetic</b>, and <b>performance evaluation</b>. Commercial computer-aided-design software is used to deepen the student's understanding of the <b>top-down processor design methodology</b>. MIPS-based assembly language will be used.

### Course Goals

By the end of this course you should be able to:
<ol> 
<li><b>Describe</b> the fundamental components required in a <b>single core</b> of a modern microprocessor as well as how they interact with each other, with <b>main memory</b>, and with <b>external storage media</b>.</li>
<li>Suggest, compare, and contrast potential <b>architectural enhancements</b> by applying appropriate <b>performance metrics</b>.</li>
<li>Apply fundamental knowledge about a <b>processor’s datapath</b>, different <b>memory hierarchies</b>, performance metrics, etc. to <b>design a microprocessor</b> such that it: 
<ul><li>meets a target set of <b>performance goals</b> and</li>
<li>is <b>realistically implementable</b>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Explain how code written in (different) high-level languages (like C, Java, C++, etc.) can be executed on different microprocessors (e.g., RISC-V, Intel, ARM, etc.) to <b>produce the result intended by the programmer</b>.</li>
<li>Use knowledge about a microprocessor’s <b>underlying hardware</b> (or “architecture”) to <b>write more efficient software</b>.</li>
<li>Describe the main architectural approaches to <b>improve computer performance</b> (circa 2004 and 2012).</li>
<li><b>Explain and articulate</b> why modern microprocessors now have <b>more than one core</b> and how software must adapt to accommodate the now prevalent <b>multi-core approach to computing</b>.</li>
</ol>
