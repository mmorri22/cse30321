### Course Catalog Description

Introduction to <b>basic architectural concepts</b> that are present in <b>current scalar machines</b>, together with an introduction to <b>assembly language programming</b>, <b>computer arithmetic</b>, and <b>performance evaluation</b>. Commercial computer-aided-design software is used to deepen the student's understanding of the <b>top-down processor design methodology</b>. MIPS-based assembly language will be used.

### Course Goals

By the end of this course you should be able to:
<ol> 
<li><b>Describe</b> the fundamental components required in a <b>single core</b> of a modern microprocessor as well as how they interact with each other, with <b>main memory</b>, and with <b>external storage media</b>.</li>
<li>Suggest, compare, and contrast potential <b>architectural enhancements</b> by applying appropriate <b>performance metrics</b>.</li>
<li>Apply fundamental knowledge about a <b>processor’s datapath</b>, different <b>memory hierarchies</b>, performance metrics, etc. to <b>design a microprocessor</b> such that it: 
<ul><li>meets a target set of <b>performance goals</b> and</li>
<li>is <b>realistically implementable</b>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Explain how code written in (different) high-level languages (like C, Java, C++, etc.) can be executed on different microprocessors (e.g., RISC-V, Intel, ARM, etc.) to <b>produce the result intended by the programmer</b>.</li>
<li>Use knowledge about a microprocessor’s <b>underlying hardware</b> (or “architecture”) to <b>write more efficient software</b>.</li>
<li>Describe the main architectural approaches to <b>improve computer performance</b> (circa 2004 and 2012).</li>
<li><b>Explain and articulate</b> why modern microprocessors now have <b>more than one core</b> and how software must adapt to accommodate the now prevalent <b>multi-core approach to computing</b>.</li>
</ol>

### Lecture Notes and Course Schedule

The Lecture Notes and Course Schedule for the Fall 2023 semester may be found on the Canvas page at https://canvas.nd.edu/courses/74671/pages/lecture-notes-and-schedule. This schedule includes all the reading assignments, in-class coding opportunities, and assignment descriptions and due dates.

> <b>Note</b>: All slides and solutions to in-class coding opportunities will be posted <i>after</i> the lecture.

### Time Outside of Class Expectations

According to Federal Law, a "Credit Hour" is <a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/dpcletters/GEN1106.pdf">legally defined as follows</a>:

> A credit hour is now formally defined, for Title IV aid purposes, as an amount of work that reasonably approximates <i>not less than</i>:<p></p>
> One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a <i>minimum</i> of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for a semester or trimester hour, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit (or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time)

This course is a <i>required</i> engineering course for Electrical Engineers that is 3 credit hours, meaning that the <u>average</u> student must undertake <i>not less than</i> six hours of work each week outside the classroom. In order to promote efficient instruction and learning, my aim is that the average student spends an efficient 2-3 hours per credit hour outside of classroom instruction on this course. The course is designed for the average student to require <b>7.5 hours per week</b> outside the classroom.

$$ { {CreditHours*(hours_{min} + hours_{max})} \over 2 } = { {3*(2+3)} \over 2 } = { {6+9} \over 2 } = 7.5 $$

The approximate breakdown of work expectation in this course per week is as follows (will vary between students):
<ul>
    <li><b>1.5 hours</b> per week of <b>preview reading</b></li>
    <li><b>1.5 hour</b> per week for <b>reviewing your in-class material</b></li>
    <li><b>4.5 hours</b> per week for <b>Homework Assignments</b></li>
</ul>

> <b>Note</b>: On the student CIF feedback over the last three years, the average student reported their time outside of class in this course as <b>7.4 hours/week</b>. This is my aim, which means we are working towards a proper balance between <b>challenging you</b> outside of the classroom and <b>respecting your time</b> requirements for other classes, activities, and responsibilities. <b>If you are struggling, please find me or a TA as soon as possible, and we will provide assistance</b>.
